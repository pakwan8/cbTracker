How to use
----------
There are two files that need attention. classlist.txt and settings.txt. 

settings.txt contains a list of temporary qr codes that can be given to any student  
in case a student from another class would like to rent. Erase NONE and fill out the  
student's name according to which qr code will be given to the student.

classlist.txt is used to generate qr codes for each student listed in the file.  
Add student's full name to the file and run 'generate_qr_codes' by opening the provided  
shortcut.
